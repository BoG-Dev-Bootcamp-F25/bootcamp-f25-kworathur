## Fall 25 Dev Bootcamp Exercises

This repository contains all the exercises and resources needed for the Fall 2025 Dev Bootcamp.

## Submitting Projects & Exercises

Throughout this bootcamp, bootcampers will submit projects and exercises through GitHub. We will utilize GitHub Organizations to make this happen.

This repo contains information and starter code for lectures, exercises, and projects. As a bootcamper, you'll be uploading all of your exercise submissions to your forked repository. Make sure to frequently click **Sync Fork** on GitHub to make sure you have up-to-date exercises and projects!

## Getting Started

1. Do `exer1` for setting up your dev environment.
2. After this, do `exer2` to set up your forked repository where you'll do future exercises and play around with demos.
